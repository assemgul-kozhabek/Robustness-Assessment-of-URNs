# Robustness-Assessment-of-URNs
This study evaluates the robustness of urban road networks by analyzing the impact of various node removal strategies, showing that targeted disruptions based on centrality measures are more effective than random ones. It highlights that shortest-path-based centrality measures degrade overall network robustness, while connectivity-based measures disrupt local efficiency, with some node removals paradoxically increasing local efficiency.
